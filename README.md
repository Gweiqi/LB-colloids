# LB-colloids
LB colloids development code

By: Joshua Larsen @ University of Arizona
PhD project development branch of LB-colloid tracking code

## LB Colloids is a package to simulate fluid flow in porous media using D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann and perform colloid particle tracking simulations

Installation of LB-Colloids is fairly easy and can be accomplished using the python installer pip. Download a zip file of the repository and open a terminal window.

Installation can be accomplished using the command

```
python -m pip install .
```

or

```
python -m pip install . -e
```

for an editable version of the installation.

If there are problems with installation or importing LB-Colloids please raise an issue or send me an email. It may be a FORTRAN compiler issue that we can work out together.

A user document/package API for the LB-Colloids package is located in the Docs/build directory as a PDF file

Examples of how to use LB-Colloids using python scripting are located in the examples/Notebooks directory. These are jupyter notebooks that can be run interactively on the user's machine if Jupyter is installed.
